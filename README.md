# LinkedInCertificationFWD
A short forwarder to get around the 255 character limit for URLs when using the LinkedIn add to profile certification button.

I work for an organisation that holds a public register of members.
We wanted to send each member a link so they can add their "membership" to their LinkedIn profile utilising the "filled form" model highlighted here: https://addtoprofile.linkedin.com/

Unfortunately, the amount of information we want to send means the URL is much longer than the 255 characters that Mailchimp allow to be used as a field in the database.
